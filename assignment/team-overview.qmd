Your assigned team will be the team you will work in for the planning, research, writing, and presentation of the team project. The project is to identify and develop a persuasive position on a matter of public policy directly related to local government administration. To this point, avoid matters that deal directly with state and Federal government, or nonprofit management. Research and develop your project based on local government, typically municipal, township, county, or a single-purpose, administration. The objective is to present an affirmative argument in favor of a position relevant to local government, as though you were a work group assigned to make a presentation to the elected officials of the unit of government.
