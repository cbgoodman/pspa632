Each team presents to the class, who will serve as the agency board, in a 15-minute presentation (exceeding the time limit will result in deduction of points) to summarize the public policy of your research topic, the case analysis and your recommendations. The presentation will include between 5-8 Power Point slides (excluding introduction and citation slides) which summarize the points offered in the presentation.
