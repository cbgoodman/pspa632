Attend and watch a governing board meeting for the agency where you are either a full-time employee or intern. Virtually attend or watch an additional governing board meeting for municipal governments online. Compare and contrast the roles and interactions of a) professional public managers, b) elected officials, and c) members of the general public during the meeting. Reflect upon these dynamics in the context of our readings on governing boards.
